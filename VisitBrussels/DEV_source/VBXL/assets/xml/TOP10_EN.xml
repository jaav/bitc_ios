<div><em>Atomium: sphere named after François Englert</em>
<div><em>After having named the event sphere Ilya Prigogine as a tribute to the Belgian Nobel Prize Winner in Chemistry 36 years ago, the Atomium has now decided to honour the new Belgian Nobel Prize Winner in Physics and name the lowest sphere, the first above the entrance, after physician and university professor François Englert.</em></div>

<h4><strong>The marriage of the 9th Art and Art Nouveau</strong></h4>
<div>Located in the heart of Brussels, in a majestic Art Nouveau building, created by Victor Horta in 1906, the Belgian Comic Strip Center opened its doors to the public on October 6th 1989. In no time this impressive museum became one of the main attractions of Brussels. Every year more than 200.000 visitors come here to explore 4.200 m² of permanent and temporary exhibitions.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<h4><strong>Permanent exhibitions</strong></h4>

<div>&#160;</div>
<div><strong>The Art of Comic Strip</strong></div>
<div>This exposition proposes to explore the comic strip in all its forms, from the creative process to the range of genres that constitute the European comic strip today.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div><strong>Horta and the Waucquez Warehouse</strong></div>

<div>&#160;</div>
<div><strong>The Museum of Imagination (1929-1959)</strong></div>
<div>This exhibition shows the greatest moments in the history of the European comic strip, popularised by the Belgian pioneers. From Hergé to Roba, it explores the careers and works of the authors who have made Belgium the Kingdom of the Comic Strip.</div>

They consist of the Cinquantenaire Museum, the Chinese Pavilion and the Japanese Tower, the Museum of Japanese Art, the Musical Instruments Museum, the Porte de Hal Museum, the Horta-Lambeaux Pavilion. The Cinquantenaire Museum is divided into four main sections: national archeology, antiquity, non-European civilisations and European decorative arts. The National Archeology section (prehistoric times, Gallo-Roman era, Merovingian period) underlines the continuous development of handicraft in the Low Countries and provides an introduction to the techniques of contemporary archeological research. The European decorative arts section presents a rich collection of sculptures, furniture, tapestries, textiles, costumes, lace, ceramics, metals, glass, vintage cars and film and photography material. Not to be missed is the Treasure Room which brings together the treasures of Art of the Meuse Valley; the route of decorative arts of the Middle Ages to the baroque period has been entirely renovated containing tapestries and reredos. Another must are the new rooms devoted to 20th century art (Art Nouveau and Art Deco). Those rooms containing items from the Antiquity (Middle East, Egypt, Greece and Rome) lead us back to the cradle of western civilisation. The scale model of Rome and the Apamee room and its life-sized colonnade warrant a special mention.The section on non-European civilisations places the visitor in contact with all the regions of the world: Asia (China, Korea, Japan, and South-East Asia), America (pre-Columbian civilisations and current traditional societies), Oceania (objects and a statue from Easter Island) and the world of Islam.
