You walk through the Mammal Gallery along recent and extinct mammals, and learn what makes them such special animals. A tunnel leads you between the North and South Pole: a view of two different worlds. Our Whale Hall not only contains majestic whales, but also dolphins, walruses, sirenians, seals... A part of the hall is devoted to the whales' role in the economy and their sacrifices to it. Apart from a magnificent collection of shells, the Shell Gallery houses a tropical aquarium and a complete survey of the lower classes of invertebrates. The nearby North Sea Discovery Room takes you on an interactive tour around beach and sea life at the Belgian coast. Insects represent about 80 % of all known animal species, so they can easily fill a whole gallery! The Insect Gallery shows the fascinating life of insects, spiders, crustaceans and other arthropods. After your visit, you'll know everything about the critters you're about to meet alive and well in the Vivarium.The Mineral Gallery has crystals, cut gems, meteorites and precious bits of moon rock. You learn about the qualities that make each mineral unique.Ready to enjoy some city life? Greet the inhabitants of your neighbourhood in "Animal Pal". Small children will have the safari of their lifetime! The latest arrival, the Evolution Gallery, invites you on a journey through the history of living things, a unique and fascinating story, through the meanderings of evolution, an ode to life, its richness and complexity.

The elephant a distant relative of the microbe?</div>]]></body><position>4</position><address><![CDATA[Rue Vautier 29/Vautierstraat 29]]></address><city><![CDATA[Bruxelles/Brussel]]></city><zipcode>1000</zipcode><phone>+32 2 627 42 11</phone><fax>+32 2 646 44 66</fax><email>info@sciencesnaturelles.be</email><website>http://www.sciencesnaturelles.be</website><latitude>50.836509</latitude><longitude>4.376493</longitude></item><item id="2012"><title><![CDATA[Comic Strip Museum]]></title><small_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/centre_belge_de_la_bande_dessinee_brussels.jpg</small_image><body><![CDATA[<p>This museum offers two visits in one: an "archaeological" discovery, since it is housed in what used to be the Waucquez warehouse (built by Victor Horta in 1906 to house a wholesale draper?s); not to mention the building?s highly original contents -  comic strips - in a setting that provides space  and light in abundance. The museum devotes much of its space to the history of the comic strip in Belgium, with Hergé undoubtedly at the head of a group whose fame is international: blow-up drawings, three-dimensional reproductions (the famous rocket used by Tintin to travel through space), etc. On the mezzanine level, the ?Espace Saint-Roch? is set aside for regularly-changing displays of some 200 items from the collection of 5000 original drawing boards.  A space dedicated to Hergé was opened in 2005. The educational side is also spotlighted: on the same level, it is possible to trace the birth and development of a comic strip and its passage to becoming an animated cartoon with the help of models and the machinery used in this type of work. Upstairs, the Museum of the Imagination and the Museum of the Modern Comic Strip present over 60 years of comic-strip creation in Belgium and Europe. Back on the ground floor, which also has a library, is the world?s largest collection of comic strips, fully computerised, with more than 30,000 volumes that can be consulted at the museum itself, and a bookshop specialising in - what else? - comic strips. A useful tip: the relaxed reading room next to the library allows each and everyone to read comic strips to their heart?s content in total calm? parents and children:of all ages !</p>]]></body><position>107</position><address><![CDATA[Rue des Sables 20/Zandstraat 20]]></address><city><![CDATA[Bruxelles/Brussel]]></city><zipcode>1000</zipcode><phone>+32 2 219 19 80</phone><fax>+32 2 219 23 76</fax><email>visit@cbbd.be</email><website>http://www.comicscenter.net</website><latitude>50.851055</latitude><longitude>4.359684</longitude></item><item id="1548"><title><![CDATA[Océade]]></title><small_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/ContentPlace_1548/img_3867.JPG</small_image><body><![CDATA[<p>This is the capital's water funpark, open all year round, with all the excitement of high-speed slides,  the charm of jacuzzis, saunas, solariums and  wavepools.

They consist of the Cinquantenaire Museum, the Chinese Pavilion and the Japanese Tower, the Museum of Japanese Art, the Musical Instruments Museum, the Porte de Hal Museum, the Horta-Lambeaux Pavilion and the Palace of Charles of Lorraine. The Cinquantenaire Museum is divided into four main sections: national archeology, antiquity, non-European civilisations and European decorative arts. The National Archeology section (prehistoric times, Gallo-Roman era, Merovingian period) underlines the continuous development of handicraft in the Low Countries and provides an introduction to the techniques of contemporary archeological research. The European decorative arts section presents a rich collection of sculptures, furniture, tapestries, textiles, costumes, lace, ceramics, metals, glass, vintage cars and film and photography material. Not to be missed is the Treasure Room which brings together the treasures of Art of the Meuse Valley; the route of decorative arts of the Middle Ages to the baroque period has been entirely renovated containing tapestries and reredos. Another must are the new rooms devoted to 20th century art (Art Nouveau and Art Deco). Those rooms containing items from the Antiquity (Middle East, Egypt, Greece and Rome) lead us back to the cradle of western civilisation. The scale model of Rome and the Apamee room and its life-sized colonnade warrant a special mention.The section on non-European civilisations places the visitor in contact with all the regions of the world: Asia (China, Korea, Japan, and South-East Asia), America (pre-Columbian civilisations and current traditional societies), Oceania (objects and a statue from Easter Island) and the world of Islam. This area also houses the "Museum of the Blind" enabling the visually handicapped to discover objects by touching them.</div>]]></body><position>105</position><address><![CDATA[Parc du Cinquantenaire 10/Jubelpark 10]]></address><city><![CDATA[Bruxelles/Brussel]]></city><zipcode>1000</zipcode><phone>+32 2 741 72 00</phone><fax>+32 2 741 72 07</fax><email>info@kmkg-mrah.be</email><website>http://www.kmkg-mrah.be</website><latitude>50.839351</latitude><longitude>4.391718</longitude></item><item id="2046"><title><![CDATA[MIM - Musical Instruments museum]]></title><small_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/musee_des_instruments_de_musique_brussels.jpg</small_image><body><![CDATA[<div>This excellent museum occupies the old Art Nouveau buildings of the Old England stores (3000m2 of exhibition space) and is one of the biggest collection of instruments in the world.
