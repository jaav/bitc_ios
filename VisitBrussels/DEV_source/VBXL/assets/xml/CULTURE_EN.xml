A Tram Experience that is now a showcase for the finest food that Brussels has to offer

While 2012 saw double Michelin-starred chefs from every corner of the country come up with fabulous dishes served onboard, this year we will be turning the spotlight on Michelin-starred chefs from Brussels. In just one meal, passengers will be invited to discover dishes by two or three different chefs, sometimes in surprising combinations. This fourhanded cooking experience makes the Tram Experience, already a unique concept, even more unique!

 

Another new feature is that the Tram Experience is no longer just for chefs, as some menus will now include desserts by some of our best chocolatiers and pastry chefs.

During this holiday season, from 10 December to 19 January, the Tram Experience will be serving an extra festive 3 course menu concocted by Brussels brightest culinary ambassadors, two starred chefs Lionel Rigolet from the Comme Chez Soi and Pascal Devalkeneer from the Chalet de la Forêt. The menu will be followed by a dessert by haute chocolatier Pierre Marcolini. ]]></body><position>0</position><address><![CDATA[]]></address><city><![CDATA[Bruxelles/Brussel]]></city><zipcode>1000</zipcode><phone></phone><fax></fax><email>info@visitbrussels.be</email><website><![CDATA[http://www.tramexperience.be]]></website><latitude></latitude><longitude></longitude></item><item id="63435"><title><![CDATA[EXPO SAX 200]]></title><small_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/ContentEvent_63435/jpg_28415.jpg </small_image><big_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/ContentEvent_63435/jpg_28414.jpg</big_image><body><![CDATA[<div>Jazz may have its roots in America, but the instrument most associated with this particular musical style - the saxophone - was invented by a Belgian. This upcoming 6 November marks the bicentenary celebration of Adolphe Sax's date of birth to the day. The ‘Sax200’ exhibition traces the man's riveting life story, which acts to illustrate the huge impact he had on the world of music.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>It is only right that Antoine-Joseph Sax's anniversary (his official name) should be celebrated in style. Same as Django Reinhardt being the only musician whose name is synonymous with a specific style, the saxophone is almost the only instrument that was named after the man who invented it. So much so in fact that his effigy featured on Belgian 200 franc notes at the time.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<h4>From Brussels to Paris</h4>
<div>Adolphe picked up the trade at his father's workshops, Initially starting out with making improvements to existing instruments. He applied for his first patent in 1838 and soon went on to design a new type of instrument that was to become the saxophone. The first official presentation of the saxophone came as early as 1841 at the Brussels Industry Exhibition. One year later he would showcase his newfangled instrument in Paris, where Sax felt more appreciated with the city of lights offering greater chances of success. As such, he soon relocated to the French capital where he started his own workshop, driven by an irrepressible urge to create new instruments. In doing so, he came up with the saxhorns, a new family of brass instruments, which would chiefly go on to be used by French military brass bands. His fertile and seemingly inexhaustible imagination produced one model after the next. His first patent for the saxophone dates back to 1846, followed in due course by further patents for the alto saxophone, the trumpet involving six independent valves and seven bells and the trombone involving six independent valves and seven bells, to name but a few.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<h4>Success and jealousy</h4>
<div>There was no getting around Adolphe Sax on the Parisian cultural scene. He became the head of the Fanfare de l’Opéra and organised concerts at his own factory where all of high society would flock to in their droves, including the great composers of the era, such as Berlioz and Meyerbeer. One thing he certainly never lacked was ambition. He got the recognition he craved but also met with his fair share of envy and jealousy, to the point of being challenged to musical duals where the counterparty would sometimes resort to underhand tactics. In fact, his opponents would frequently take him to court. And even though time and again he would win every court case brought against him, they also left him broken. Adolphe Sax died on 7 February 1894. In 1928, French musical instrument company Selmer took over the business and the name. However, in 2012 ‘Adolphe Sax &amp; Cie’ came home to Belgium, with the instruments available to be delivered worldwide.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>Adolphe Sax was anything but an amateur inventor. His was a more than eventful life that saw him reap success as well as face his share of contempt and adversity. But above all else, he was a go-getter and a good businessman, family traits he inherited from his father Charles-Joseph who was also in the business of inventing things. After all, the family ran a company in Brussels and was even appointed purveyor to the Royal Household of William I of Orange.</div>
<div>And let us not lose sight of the fact that we are talking about an era that was constantly swept by change. The industrial revolution was in full swing. Which also highlights one of the strong points of this exhibition: the human story of Adolphe Sax, which is colourful in itself, is put into historical and social context. In a musical sense, his influence covers anything from the development of brass bands to the major role the saxophone would go on to play in the world of jazz. The latter aspect is not just something you get to see but above all listen to.</div>
<div>The MIM drew from its own collection consisting of over a hundred Sax-designed wind instruments and added in a whole string of exceptional pieces, borrowed from private collections, for good measure.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<h4>A wide range of activities</h4>
<div>The schedule of events tying in with this exhibition is enormous as well as highly varied. The easiest way to get some bird's-eye perspective of what is going on is to consult the website for the latest up-to-date changes. However, a number of the main activities have already been finalised, including the special series of concerts set to be held on Sunday afternoons, the ‘Adolphe Sax, his influence and legacy’ colloquium (3-5 July) and the lunchtime concerts by Les Lundis D’Hortense (the association of Belgian jazz musicians). The MIM will be staging themed tours, family days, master classes and a dedicated children's track. Please note that the MIM has a free admission policy every first Wednesday afternoon of the month!</div>

<div>For the First World War 100th anniversary commemorations, the Royal Army Museum will organise the major exhibition " 14-18, it's our history ! " as from February 26, 2014.

The role of this exhibition is to awaken a wider audience, who has forgotten how history has shaped his life, to the story of the history of the European war – then global.

They rediscovered their figures, enhanced by skilful cuts and fabrics used on the bias, hugging the body. Appropriate underwear sculpted the silhouette, which was now slender. Hair was worn longer and waved, hairstyles became more voluminous. Outfits were set off by a small hat, worn on the side of the head.</div>

To showcase this remarkable experience that the Belgian capital underwent in 1914-1918 and to do so in an original and innovative manner, the City Museum located on the Grand-Place has decided to contextualize the exhibition “14-18 Brussels on German time”, which is to run from 21 August 2014 to 3 May 2015, from the point of view of a European history of the world's first global conflict. Its aim is to compare the day-to-day lives of the people of Brussels with those of the inhabitants of other major German cities.

The exhibition will also pay very special attention to looking after young visitors, with an educational notebook and children's route being offered for school or family visits. ]]></body><position>0</position><address><![CDATA[Grand-Place/Grote Markt]]></address><city><![CDATA[Bruxelles/Brussel]]></city><zipcode>1000</zipcode><phone>02-279.43.50</phone><fax>02-279.43.62</fax><email>musea@brucity.be</email><website><![CDATA[http://www.museedelavilledebruxelles.be]]></website><latitude>50.846975</latitude><longitude>4.351816</longitude></item><item id="77208"><title><![CDATA[Peintures Partagées / Dypréau]]></title><small_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/ContentEvent_77208/jpg_30097.jpg</small_image><big_image></big_image><body><![CDATA[From 1952 until the end of his life Jean Dypréau (Brussels, 1917-1986) was a committed and critical voice in the artistic life, especially in Brussels. He wrote critiques in art magazines as Temps Mêlés, Quadrum, Phantomas, XXe Siècle, Journal des Beaux-Arts et Plus, introductions of expositions in galleries and art centers as Galerie Aujourd&apos;hui, Galerie Ad Libitum, Le Zodiaque, the Palace of Fine arts and several other galleries and art centers interior and abroad, and essays for cultural publications and  museums. His interest lay in informal and abstract art, and pop art.



It will be no surprise that all the artists Dypréau wrote about are present in the collections of the Royal Museums. At the occasion of the publication of his collected writings, a selection from the collection modern art will be put to display in the Patio. These artists were close to the heart of Dypréau. In a separate section of about 8 paintings, which were also on display in the exhibition of 1959, will be presented. ]]></body><position>0</position><address><![CDATA[rue de la Régence/Regentschapsstraat]]></address><city><![CDATA[Bruxelles/Brussel]]></city><zipcode>1000</zipcode><phone>02-508.32.11</phone><fax>02-508.32.32</fax><email>info@fine-arts-museum.be</email><website><![CDATA[http://www.fine-arts-museum.be]]></website><latitude>50.839996</latitude><longitude>4.356223</longitude></item><item id="83554"><title><![CDATA[The Power of Object(s) - Design Bestsellers in Belgium]]></title><small_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/ContentEvent_83554/jpg_30238.jpg</small_image><big_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/ContentEvent_83554/jpg_30237.jpg</big_image><body><![CDATA[<div><span style="color: rgb(149, 142, 136); font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">What is design?

Why doesn't every icon become a bestseller and vice-versa? How has it come about that, after a century of being ignored, Belgian design is suddenly doing so exceedingly well abroad? These are just a few of the many questions to be raised at The Power of Object(s), an exhibition that is centred on the concept of "success". On the initiative of Danny Venlet, himself a leading Belgian designer, MAD Brussels (Mode and Design Center) and ING Belgium are combining forces in this ambitious, not-to-be-missed event. This will open during the coming Design September Festival, and promises to become a top cultural autumn attraction.</span></div>

Tardi is one of the most famous and highly respected Francophone comic book authors, and for the last 40 years, with ?Putain de Guerre !? (Goddamn this war!) and ?C?était la Guerre des Tranchées? (It was the war of the trenches), Jacques Tardi has focused his work on the First World War. Although his tales are fictional, his dedication to truthfulness is a key to his work and offers a human perspective of the conflict, which makes it stand out from a more traditional ?heroic? version.

Sienese artists developed their own style over time, evolving from the rigid patterns of late-Byzantine iconography to more narrative works of art. The exhibition showcases sixty masterpieces which bear testimony to a revolutionary form of art which, from the thirteenth century until the fifteenth century, took an increasing interest in space and in exploration of human emotions and used brilliant, unusual colours. The Sienese school inspired other arts centres in Italy and finally left its mark all over Europe. A unique opportunity to see these masterpieces in Brussels!

&#160;</div>
<div>Constantin Meunier, who was born on 12 April 1831 in Etterbeek and died on 4 April 1905 in Ixelles/Elsene, is a Belgian sculptor and painter. He is one of the first artists portraying the social reality at the end of the 19th century in Europe.</div>
<div>Meunier starts his career as a sculptor. Between 1857 and 1884 however, he devotes himself to painting. After visiting a few mines and industries, Meunier expresses his interest for workers in his paintings, mainly miners in the Borinage region, dock workers in Antwerp, steelworkers and women workers. <br />
&#160;</div>
<div>It is only after a stay in Spain where he mainly paints religious scenes that Meunier goes back to bronze sculpting exploring various social themes.<br />
&#160;</div>
<div>Nevertheless, this exhibition aims to provide a varied overview of the complete work of the artist. For this reason, special attention will be paid to the paintings from the first decades of his career which, to date, have hardly been studied: historical tableaux, civil portraits and religious scenes. As no other the oeuvre of Constantin Meunier is reflecting the main movements and developments in Belgian art from the second half of the 19th century. Alongside a representative selection of paintings and bronzes, a captivating selection of works on paper and documents will be shown.<br />
&#160;</div>
<div>Constant Meunier’s works of art are to be found across the city. Get acquainted with this major artist through the Meunier trail including the places where he lived as well as his oeuvre integrated in the Brussels landscape: <a target="_blank" href="http://expo-meunier.be/en/meunier-trail">http://expo-meunier.be/en/meunier-trail</a>.</div>

The power of music seen by visual artists]]></title><small_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/ContentEvent_81159/jpg_30530.jpg</small_image><big_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/ContentEvent_81159/jpg_30529.jpg</big_image><body><![CDATA[<div>Music Palace, as a call for freedom that awakens all the promises of the music in the sumptuous setting of the Villa Empain !</div>
<div>In this exhibition, a selection of contemporary work examines the relationship between music and cultures through artistic creation. With boldness, humor and enthusiasm, these works will rock the Villa Empain becoming a 'Music Palace' for the occasion.</div>
<div>Music has this power to transport us, to have a complete hold over us, to rid us of our inhibitions, and play with our bodies, our minds, and their rhythms.</div>
<div>Music also has this strange ability to galvanize crowds, and bring people together in an odd communion, something which has not escaped the notice of the political world of different cultures and periods.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>The history, phenomenology and sociology of modern and contemporary music run parallel with the development of technologies and their distribution. Radio and television, with their music stations and channels, have undoubtedly contributed to the commercialization of music and its standards. But the growth of its diffusion, production and consumption, greatly helped nowadays by digitization, permits the discovery of artists, singers and musicians who elude the usual distribution channels.</div>
<div>Like a shock wave, music can thus be imposed on the collective imagination in unexpected ways. The Mahraganat phenomenon, also called Electro Chaâbi, offers recent proof of this. Starting from the working-class suburbs of Cairo, transmitted by cell phone, Mahraganat concerts have electrified a whole generation of young people who identify with them, re-invent themselves in them, and find in them an energy which transgresses prohibitions.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>"Music is the supreme mystery of the human sciences, the one against which they stumble, and which holds the key to their progress", said Claude Lévi-Strauss in The Raw and the Cooked in 1964. We might extend this observation to artistic creation as a whole, and note the links and cross-links constructed between these different manners of creation and expression.</div>
<div>In this show, a selection of visual works questions the relations between music and the culture which convey it, as well as between music and the social phenomena which it introduces and incarnates. With daring, wit, and keen verve, these works will make the Villa Empain throb !</div>]]></body><position>0</position><address><![CDATA[avenue Franklin Roosevelt/Franklin Rooseveltlaan]]></address><city><![CDATA[Bruxelles/Brussel]]></city><zipcode>1000</zipcode><phone>02-627.52.30</phone><fax></fax><email>info@boghossianfoundation.be</email><website><![CDATA[http://www.villaempain.com]]></website><latitude>50.806529</latitude><longitude>4.385703</longitude></item><item id="55093"><title><![CDATA[Rubens and his Legacy.]]></title><small_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/ContentEvent_55093/jpg_11556.jpg </small_image><big_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/ContentEvent_55093/jpg_11555.jpg</big_image><body><![CDATA[An exhibition that explores the artistic legacy of Peter Paul Rubens. Organised jointly by the Royal Academy of Arts in London and the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp, it is on show in Brussels because the Antwerp museum is closed for renovations.

Rubens was the most influential Flemish painter. Jacob Burckhardt characterized the broad range of his oeuvre – religious works, mythological scenes, landscapes, and portraits – as truly Homerian. Himself indebted to Titian, Rubens became a role model for Van Dyck, Rembrandt, and Velázquez.

This overview is arranged thematically, in an introduction and seven chapters: Violence, Power, Lust, Compassion, Elegance, and Peace. It contains works by a wide range of artists, including Rembrandt, Jordaens, Van Dyck, Watteau, Fragonard, Reynolds, Delacroix, Gainsborough, Constable, Turner, Manet, Daumier, Renoir, and Picasso.]]></body><position>0</position><address><![CDATA[rue Ravenstein/Ravensteinstraat]]></address><city><![CDATA[Bruxelles/Brussel]]></city><zipcode>1000</zipcode><phone>02-507.82.00</phone><fax></fax><email>info@bozar.be</email><website><![CDATA[http://www.bozar.be]]></website><latitude>50.844237</latitude><longitude>4.359539</longitude></item><item id="80163"><title><![CDATA[Mark Leckey - ‘Lending Enchantment to Vulgar Materials ‘]]></title><small_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/ContentEvent_80163/jpg_30540.jpg</small_image><big_image></big_image><body><![CDATA[Mark Leckey (born 1964 in Birkenhead, lives and works in London) works in sculpture, sound, performance, and video. His earliest works as well as his most recent performances and installations equally reveal his resolute fascination with the material thing-ness of objects and the immaterial, pervasively disseminated digital image. Combing the iconography of popular culture, its brands and its products, and their relationship to desire, identity, and memory, his work explores the affective power that these exert on us. For his exhibition at WIELS, his first in Belgium and one of his largest to date, the artist will present a panoramic survey of both new and older work in addition to an artist-curated exhibition within the exhibition.

On Saturday 11 October, the Week of Popular Philosophy plays host to several philosophers for get-togethers for a ‘fashion and philosophy’ evening.

<div>For quite a few years, MAD Brussels has been regularly organising fashion and design seminars to inform the general public and professionals about themes related to the reality of the sectors. This month, the fashion seminar is focussing on ‘Storytelling’, the way in which brands tell their story and put the spotlight on themselves to satisfy customers and followers. This is all about a communication tool that needs to be mastered with the rise to prominence of social networks. Speakers: Jean-Charles de la Faille, a storytelling consultant, and Salma Haouach, a content marketing strategist.</div>

Exhibitions open until 31 Octoberl</div>
<div>MAD Brussels has invited the French artist Marc Turlan and his ‘SEXY IS SEXY’ exhibition, which looks at the descriptive adjective ‘sexy’. Turlan looked into the meaning of the word ‘sexy’, which is ultra-modern, international, colloquial and an attitude and is therefore understood by everyone. In this exhibition, Turlan sets out his thinking on the word as applied to art.</div>
<div>In 2014, the Festival International de la Mode et de la Photographie de Hyères [The International Festival of Fashion and Photography of Hyères] and MAD Brussels joined forces. After the live broadcasting of the fashion parade at the Bozar in April, MAD is playing host to a mini-exhibition that displays ten silhouettes from the 2014 nominees for the 29th edition of the festival to the former Christophe Coppens workshop.</div>

The exhibition starts in the Roman Empire, with the rare Tabula Militaris Itineraria Theodosiana or Tabula Peutingeriana, which describes the whole known world in the time of Emperor Constantine.



Through maps from different centuries, we see both the development of Europe and the development of cartography, which evolves into a science with its own particular symbolic language. The shared European history that we find in these maps sheds a light on the progress of European nations and peoples up to the present day.



This unique Italian collection has travelled to Brussels in honour of the Italian Presidency of the European Council, and is available to view at the Parlamentarium until 14th November.]]></body><position>0</position><address><![CDATA[Rue Wiertz/Wiertzstraat]]></address><city><![CDATA[Bruxelles/Brussel]]></city><zipcode>1000</zipcode><phone>02-283.22.22</phone><fax></fax><email>parlamentarium@europarl.europa.eu</email><website><![CDATA[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/visiting/fr/visits/parlamentarium.html]]></website><latitude>50.839362</latitude><longitude>4.376093</longitude></item><item id="88454"><title><![CDATA[Hans Op de Beeck  -'The Drawing Room']]></title><small_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/ContentEvent_88454/jpg_30606.jpg</small_image><big_image></big_image><body><![CDATA[]]></body><position>0</position><address><![CDATA[rue Royale/Koningsstraat]]></address><city><![CDATA[Saint-Josse-Ten-Noode/Sint-Joost-Ten-Node]]></city><zipcode>1210</zipcode><phone>02-218.37.32</phone><fax></fax><email>info@botanique.be</email><website><![CDATA[http://www.botanique.be]]></website><latitude>50.855579</latitude><longitude>4.366964</longitude></item><item id="88479"><title><![CDATA[Pink Screens Film Festival]]></title><small_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/ContentEvent_88479/jpg_30605.jpg</small_image><big_image></big_image><body><![CDATA[]]></body><position>0</position><address><![CDATA[]]></address><city><![CDATA[Bruxelles/Brussel]]></city><zipcode>1000</zipcode><phone></phone><fax>02-512.20.76</fax><email>info@gdac.org</email><website><![CDATA[http://www.pinkscreens.org]]></website><latitude>0.0</latitude><longitude>0.0</longitude></item><item id="64260"><title><![CDATA[Ars Musica 2014 - 'Mini-Maxi']]></title><small_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/ContentEvent_3249/img_3326.jpg </small_image><big_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/ContentEvent_3249/img_3325.jpg</big_image><body><![CDATA[]]></body><position>0</position><address><![CDATA[]]></address><city><![CDATA[Bruxelles/Brussel]]></city><zipcode>1000</zipcode><phone></phone><fax>02-219.88.14</fax><email>info@arsmusica.be</email><website><![CDATA[http://www.arsmusica.be]]></website><latitude>0.0</latitude><longitude>0.0</longitude></item><item id="63413"><title><![CDATA[Lascaux - The Sistine Chapel of the Prehistory]]></title><small_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/ContentEvent_63413/jpg_29911.jpg</small_image><big_image></big_image><body><![CDATA[<div>This exhibition provides a golden opportunity to explore the art and culture of pre-Columbian Costa Rica. Sandwiched between two oceans, this volcanic country covered by forests (tropical humid and dry) has a particular cultural identity that has been determined by its geography and rich fauna and flora and by its location between the influences of Mesoamerica and Columbia.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>These small, autonomous communities that never experienced external domination, produced a very colored and rich production of artifacts for everyday life or to honor the deceased. The variety of the ceramic production, the refinement of the designs, the richness of the material used make of this artistic production, an art equivalent to that of the great civilizations better known as those of the Olmecs and the Mayas.</div>
<div>Approximately 350 items are on display here in an open setting in which the biotope is suggested by means of enlarged photographs, film images, sound, subtly planned lighting and various applications. Typical of the art of the period are the stone sculptures of warriors, hybrid creatures and altars, the figurines and the jewelry of jade and gold. The depictions are often of creatures from the animal world, such as felines (jaguar, ocelot, puma…) frogs, bats, snakes and various birds.</div>
<div>This prestigious exhibition shows objects never presented outside of Costa Rica like wonderful golden objects, sculptures in basalt and  wood and jade pendants.</div>]]></body><position>0</position><address><![CDATA[Parc du Cinquantenaire/Jubelpark]]></address><city><![CDATA[Bruxelles/Brussel]]></city><zipcode>1000</zipcode><phone>+32 (0)2 741 72 15</phone><fax>02-733.77.35</fax><email>info@kmkg-mrah.be</email><website><![CDATA[http://www.kmkg-mrah.be]]></website><latitude>50.83856</latitude><longitude>4.391508</longitude></item><item id="88708"><title><![CDATA[Winter Wonders]]></title><small_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/ContentEvent_88708/jpg_30696.jpg</small_image><big_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/ContentEvent_88708/jpg_30695.jpg</big_image><body><![CDATA[]]></body><position>0</position><address><![CDATA[]]></address><city><![CDATA[Bruxelles/Brussel]]></city><zipcode>1000</zipcode><phone>http://www.winterpret.be</phone><fax></fax><email></email><website><![CDATA[]]></website><latitude>0.0</latitude><longitude>0.0</longitude></item><item id="64731"><title><![CDATA[Nocturnes of the Sablon 2014]]></title><small_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/ContentEvent_45491/jpg_10287.jpg </small_image><big_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/ContentEvent_45491/jpg_10286.jpg</big_image><body><![CDATA[]]></body><position>0</position><address><![CDATA[]]></address><city><![CDATA[Bruxelles/Brussel]]></city><zipcode>1000</zipcode><phone></phone><fax>02-511.88.56</fax><email></email><website><![CDATA[http://www.sablon-bruxelles.com]]></website><latitude>0.0</latitude><longitude>0.0</longitude></item><item id="85244"><title><![CDATA[Rosinski of Poland]]></title><small_image>http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/static/front/img/db/ContentEvent_85244/jpg_30548.jpg</small_image><big_image></big_image><body><![CDATA[He studied drawing and painting at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts before launching into a prolific career as an illustrator, gathering experience and experimenting with different graphic styles.

So it's high time for the first major exhibition

about this pair of Belgian sporting legends.

Authentic race cars that made ‘Mister Le Mans' great, original racing bikes on which ‘The Cannibal' broke the One Hour world record or won the climb to the Col du Tourmalet, never-before-seen photos and films, and highlights and memorabilia from national and international collections, are all brought together for the first time at the Heysel in Brussels



in a dazzling display covering no less than 2000 square metres. Eddy Merckx and Jacky Ickx have also given us some of their personal souvenirs to put on show. Add to this the interactive exhibition route and the stunning installation by renowned Belgian photographer Stephan Vanfleteren and you have a complete and fascinating picture of what made these two extraordinary sporting heroes great.

Magic carpets and drones]]></title><small_image></small_image><big_image></big_image><body><![CDATA[“Somewhere, beyond good and evil, there is a garden. I will meet you in it.”

Djalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi



“The traditional garden of the Persians was a sacred place designed to bring together within its rectangle four parts representing the four parts of the world, with an area in the middle even more sacred than the others, which was like the umbilicus, the world's navel (this was where the basin and the fountain were); and all the garden's vegetation had to be distributed in this area, in this kind of microcosm. As for the carpets, they were originally reproductions of gardens. The garden is a carpet where the whole world achieves its symbolic perfection, and the carpet is a sort of garden moving through space. The garden is the smallest parcel of the world, it is the totality of the world”.

Michel Foucault



The magic carpet has long been a symbolic way of travelling around the world. In Persian mythology. King Solomon had a magic carpet. The queen of Sheba, who was said to be a magician, allegedly offered him this fabulous gift. It is even said that the king could transport his whole palace on it...

The magic carpet referred to in tales was popularized by One Thousand and One Nights, and has also been depicted in many a fantasy film.

Some scientists have focused on this legendary object, seeing therein an aerial replica of the way the manta ray moves in water. Physicists have even become involved in research to make a carpet fly !...

But the magic—flying—carpet also conjures up that ancestral dream, of flying like a bird. After Icarus, the first man to soar up into the ether, Leonardo da Vinci became caught up in designing highly ingenious flying objects.

Since then, flying saucers have haunted the modern imagination, well beyond all the technical  performances which have really enabled people to travel through the air, and launch a very diverse selection of flying machines.

At the present time, our minds are occupied by drones: as remote-controlled flying machines, drones are opening up a boundless field of possibilities. From observation to inspection, from transporting things to carrying weapons, nothing seems to elude the promise of their performances. For better or for worse...



The exhibition From Heaven to Hell, on view at the Villa Empain in early 2015, will broach the theme of flying machines and carpets from different angles: the symbolism of old carpets and the symbolism of the geometry of the gardens inspiring  it, the age-old dream of flying and imaginary flying objects, the world seen from the sky, the occupation of space by satellites, and the worldwide development of drones and its consequences.

Many artists are being invited to take part in this show, or will be represented in it, including (list to be completed):

This question is the point of departure for Work/Travail/Arbeid. In response, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker reimagines her piece Vortex  Temporum for the radically different temporal, spatial, and perceptual conditions of a museal space. The choreographer does not simply bring a dance performance into a new kind of space, but rethinks it as a nine weeks long exhibition, accessible to the public and continuously performed during regular opening hours. The original choreography, made for the condensed time and space of a stage performance will thus be entirely reinvented so as to extend itself across a new time and space. This project transforms the conditions that have long been essential to dance and gives a new form to the rigorous choreographic writing for which De Keersmaeker is known.

For the purpose, a selection has been made from the Cinquantenaire Museum's own collection of Japanese prints, which runs into more than 7500 examples and which enjoys worldwide fame, thanks to the great number of prints that have retained their original colours. The last time that such an extensive exhibition was organized in Belgium was in 1989, within the context of Europalia Japan.



The Japanese term ukiyo-e means literally ‘image of the floating world' and originated in the language of Buddhism, in which the ‘floating world' refers to the earthly life, characterized by suffering and transitoriness. As time passed, this negative connotation was lost and the ‘floating world' became synonymous with a world of hedonism. From the second half of the eighteenth century on, such pictorial artists as Harunobu, Shunshô, Kiyonaga, Utamaro and Sharaku depicted this in their prints of courtesans (bijin-ga) and actors (yakusha-e), the idols of night life in Edo (the present Tokyo). Iconic artists such as Hokusai and Hiroshige had immortalized the traditional Japan in their landscapes, whereas the print art of the end of the nineteenth century reflected the opening-up of Japan to the external world and to consequent modernization. The exhibition also gives space to specific themes, such as luxurious private editions (surimono), erotic prints (shunga), the refined production of Osaka (kamigata-e) and the new print art of the early twentieth century (shin-hanga).]]></body><position>0</position><address><![CDATA[Parc du Cinquantenaire/Jubelpark]]></address><city><![CDATA[Bruxelles/Brussel]]></city><zipcode>1000</zipcode><phone>02-741.72.11</phone><fax>02-733.77.35</fax><email>info@kmkg-mrah.be</email><website><![CDATA[http://www.kmkg-mrah.be]]></website><latitude>50.841393</latitude><longitude>4.390483</longitude></item><item id="84289"><title><![CDATA[Pop Art in Belgium]]></title><small_image></small_image><big_image></big_image><body><![CDATA[]]></body><position>0</position><address><![CDATA[place Royale/Koningsplein]]></address><city><![CDATA[Bruxelles/Brussel]]></city><zipcode>1000</zipcode><phone>02-547.22.92</phone><fax>02-537.38.00</fax><email>art.department@ing.be</email><website><![CDATA[http://www.ing.be/art]]></website><latitude>50.842451</latitude><longitude>4.359245</longitude></item><item id="83579"><title><![CDATA[Brosella Guitar Fair 2015]]></title><small_image></small_image><big_image></big_image><body><![CDATA[A major event for guitar-lovers, instrument-makers, and musicians, which attracts visitors from all over Europe.]]></body><position>0</position><address><![CDATA[Place de Belgique - Heysel/Belgiëplein - Heizel]]></address><city><![CDATA[Laeken/Laken]]></city><zipcode>1020</zipcode><phone>02-474.82.77</phone><fax>02-474.83.90</fax><email>info@brosella.be</email><website><![CDATA[http://www.brosella.be]]></website><latitude>50.891149</latitude><longitude>4.337545</longitude></item><item id="83578"><title><![CDATA[Nocturnes du Sablon 2015]]></title><small_image></small_image><big_image></big_image><body><![CDATA[The shops and stands in the Sablon/Zavel area stay open to 11 pm for these festive end-of-year celebrations.
